# Unanamed Physics Engine
This is an impulse based physics engine I have written in c++ using SFML for the graphics. It is currently not very stable and becomes very slow with a large number of objects. The engine uses the seperating axis theorem to determine collisions and to find the normal and depth of the collisions.
