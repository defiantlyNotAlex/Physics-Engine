physics objects should own their colliders
replace the vectors for collision points with arrays to reduce indirection and heap usage -done made a huge improvement in speed

change the normal vectors list to a buffer or make it test them as it gets them
change polygon to take in a static size and use array for vertices

replace the shapes with shape specific colliders to decrease levels of polymorphism
try to get the physics objects stored in a in a flat vector to improve cache locality
make the physics update not framerate dependent
